#Netflx-Data

     My first project, Netflix Aggregate Review and Award Analysis was my final project for my Data 115 - Introduction to Analytics class. 
     It was the first real analytical project I have ever completed and required me to learn how to find interesting data sets and think critically and creatively about what information I can convey. 
     I found that in the beginning, my ideas were way too big in scope and very difficult to achieve with the time I had. I was interested in analyzing too many factors about the TV shows and Movies and with my limited experience using R Studio and writing R Markdown Files I realized I needed to make my project much simpler. 
     In the end I settled for looking at what peoples general opinions on shows and movies were by examining the online review website scores, I figured this would be a good stand in for the average consumer's thoughts. I also examined awards given by the industry such as academy and film festival awards. I figured that these would be good to establish what the actual film industry's opinions would be. Then after establishing some basic validity,  I compared the two because I wanted to see where the disagreements were. I did not go super in-depth but an interesting future project once I have more experience with analytics would be looking further into the cases where there is a moderate to large disagreement between awards and user review scores and figuring out potential reasons why.
